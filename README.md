Create a Single AWS VPC with a JSON Copde

This is the AWS JSON Template that creates a VPC with single Subnet which scattered across two avaiability zones. I took care of creating Internet Gateway, a routing table & assosiating the routing table to the Subnet that is creating as a part of the Stack.
